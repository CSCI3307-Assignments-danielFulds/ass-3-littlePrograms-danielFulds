Exp7_HelloArray - Example Java project created via STS as Java Project, showing how to:

declare an array variable (MainEntry)
constructing(allocating memory for) an array (and initializing an array variable) (MainEntry)
declare & construct(allocate memory) in 1 line (MainEntry)
initializing elements of array (MainEntry)
short cut to declare & construct(allocate memory) & initialize elements of an array in 1 line (MainEntry)
have array of primitives or Classes (i.e objects) (MainEntry)
passed array reference (MainEntry.strArrayPassedByReference)
multi dimensional arrays ((MainEntry.main)
foreach loop on arrays ((MainEntry.main)
"variable inputs" to methods gets passed in as array (MainEntry.average)

Exp7_HelloArrayList - Example Java project created via STS as Java Project, to show case collections' List (ArrayList), showing:

collections' generic ArrayList is a concrete implementation of collections' List interface.
so, declare variables' type as List, but let them point(get initialized) to ArrayList instance
List declarations
initialization of List variables with ArrayList
we do not need to set a size (like we do with arrays). Its size is dynamic.
declaration and initialization together
filling up ArrayList instances
default toString() of ArrayList takes care of converting it to String properly. Hence printing it is easy
"add"
"add" at a specific index
"contains"
"indexOf"
"get"	at an index
"size"
for each loop over the List
"addAll" to add all elements of another List
converting an array to ArrayList using Arrays.asList
"remove" a specific element
"remove" at an index
"clear"
